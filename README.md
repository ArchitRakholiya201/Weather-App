# Flutter Weather App
A simple weather app built with Flutter that provides users with current weather information and a 7-day forecast. The app features two screens:

1. Home Screen: Displays the current weather conditions along with the 24-hour weather forecast for today.
2. 7-Day Forecast Screen: Shows the weather forecast for the next 7 days.

# Features
- Location-based Weather: Fetches weather data based on the user's current location.
- WeatherAPI Integration: Utilizes the WeatherAPI's APIs to fetch weather information.
- State Management: Uses flutter_riverpod for state management.
- Animations: Includes animations to enhance the user experience on both screens.
